# BTTI
A project to rescue the BTTI database and turn it into a reliable static site

The widely-used British Book Trade Index database hosted by the Bodleian Libraries
has been taken down, and replaced by a TSV dump of the database tables available
at https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:19b63441-9497-4b07-903b-ec5742c44806 under
a CC Attribution-NonCommercial (CC BY-NC) licence.

This project aims to generate from the db dump a functional static site that 
makes the data once again searchable and browsable. The site will be fully 
Endings-compliant (https://endings.uvic.ca/compliance.html), and anyone will 
be able to build it for themselves and host it on their own servers.

This project follows the CC Attribution-NonCommercial (CC BY-NC) licence placed
on the original data, and we fully acknowledge and appreciate the work and skill
that went into creating the original database. We do not intend to make any 
changes to the data, just to make it once more available in a form that is 
useful for scholars.
